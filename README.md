This is my first CCNA-Project. When I started this journey i didn t even think about the things i would be able to create, it represents my work for the last 6 months and what i was able to achieve.
In this project i simulated a small network using the concepts i learned during ccna 2: HSRP, VLAN, DHCP, SPT, Static routing, L2 security, Inter-Vlan Routing.
